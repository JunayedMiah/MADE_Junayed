## Title
Income Inequality, Education Access, and Economic Growth in the Americas.

## Main Question

1. How do income inequality and education access influence economic growth in the Americas?

## Description

In this project, the specifics of tertiary education enrollment in the Americas are described to study inequality in access to higher education as well as potential causes. It will use World Bank data to explore enrollment rates in proportion to standard socio-economic characteristics such as GDP per capita, income inequality, and government education spending. It aims to identify countries those having large amounts of inequality in educational access by data visualization and correlation analysis. Finally, the results will provide conclusions for the policy-maker's and educators interventions needed to enhance the accessibility of higher education in the region.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: World Bank Group
* Metadata URL: https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/home
* Data URL: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.TER.ENRR?view=chart&locations=US-AG-BS-BB-BZ-CA-CR-CU-DO-SV-GD-GT-HT-HN-JM-MX-NI-PA-KN-LC-VC-TT-AR-BO-BR-CL-CO-EC-GY-PY-PE-SR-UY-VE
* Data Type: CSV

From the World Bank data, it gives the percentage of people enrolled in tertiary education across different countries in the Americas. With this information, we get to know how participation in higher education is distributed and its relation to factors such as income and economic development.
